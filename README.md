# 🏋️ GymOS v3.5

### [🔴 CLICK TO VIEW LIVE WORKOUT](https://alexsgittyhub.github.io/gym-display/)

**GymOS** is a "headless" workout display system powered by a custom OpenAI GPT. It serves as a dashboard for my home gym, displaying daily programming, calculating plate math, and tracking intra-set performance data.

> **Concept:** The AI acts as the coach (planning, logic, progression), GitHub acts as the database, and this web app acts as the dumb terminal.

## ⚡ Features

### 🧠 AI-Driven Architecture
* **Zero Manual Entry:** Workouts are generated by "Fitness GPT" and pushed directly to this repository via the GitHub API.
* **Dynamic Parsing:** The display renders differently based on the exercise type:
    * **Lifts:** Generates specific input boxes for every set prescribed.
    * **Runs:** Asks for Time and Incline %.
    * **Bodyweight:** Asks for Total Rep volume.
    * **Mobility:** Read-only display.

### 🖥️ The Display (iPad/TV)
* **Cyberpunk UI:** High-contrast dark mode designed for visibility in a dim garage gym.
* **Smart Features:**
    * **🏆 PR Badges:** Automatically flags previous "Last Best" performance for motivation.
    * **🧮 Plate Math:** Clicking any weight (e.g., "225 lbs") pops up a visual diagram of exactly which plates to load per side.
    * **⏱️ Auto-Timers:** One-click rest timers based on the specific block configuration.
    * **💡 Wake Lock:** Prevents the device screen from sleeping during sessions.

### 🔄 The Feedback Loop
* **One-Click Logging:** Inputs are aggregated into a clean text summary button.
* **Clipboard Sync:** Clicking "Log Result" formats the data for the AI log reader, allowing me to paste it back into ChatGPT so it can update its memory for progressive overload.

## ⚙️ Architecture

1.  **The Brain (ChatGPT):** I request a workout (e.g., "Heavy Lower Body"). The GPT generates the plan using a strict JSON schema.
2.  **The Transport (GitHub API):** The GPT uses a Python script to Base64 encode the JSON (handling Unicode/Emojis safely) and pushes a commit to `workout.json`.
3.  **The Database (GitHub Repo):** Hosting the raw data file.
4.  **The View (GitHub Pages):** `index.html` fetches the raw JSON, parses it, and renders the DOM elements.

## 🛠️ JSON Schema (v5)

The application expects `workout.json` to follow this strict schema. If the schema breaks, the app falls back to "Demo Mode."

```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "title": "string",
  "notes": "string",
  "warmup": {
    "description": "string",
    "items": ["string"]
  },
  "blocks": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "rest_seconds": 120,
      "instructions": "string",
      "apple_watch": "string (optional)",
      "exercises": [
        {
          "name": "string",
          "type": "lift | run | bodyweight | mobility",
          "sets": 4, 
          "reps": "string",
          "load": "string",
          "last_best": "string (optional)",
          "notes": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
